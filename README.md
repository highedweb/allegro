The zero backend map app.  Thanks to advances in javascript like [Calvin Metcalf's shapefile-js](https://github.com/calvinmetcalf/shapefile-js) and [Makina Corpus' Layer Index](http://makinacorpus.github.io/Leaflet.LayerIndex/), spectacular GIS things can happen in the browser.

This viewer consumes static shapefiles living in, on, and occasionally under the interwebs.  CORS data providers play nicely, others must go via proxy (yes, there's a .NET proxy in there) (hail spawn of Satan)
